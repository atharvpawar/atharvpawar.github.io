											<h3><a href="https://trailerize.herokuapp.com/">Trailerize</a></h3>
											<p>
												This was a project I did for the course EECS 605 Data Science and Machine Learning Lab. I created a React App that generates
												a short summary or a trailer for the input video. The app's backend was hosted on Amazon's AWS Cloud Service and deployed
												on an EC2 instance. The video is broken down into frames on the server, and then individual Lambda instances are triggered
												for every frame in the video that process the frame and generate a score for each frame. Then all the frames with a score above
												a certain threshold get collated into the final summary video and is made available for viewing. The demo website can be found
												<a href="https://trailerize.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. This project gave me valuable experience in cloud service deployment, Javascript
												(React App), HTML, CSS, Python requests library, Amazon's AWS infrastructure as well reinforced my knowledge of Pytorch and Python.

											<h3>BERT Models for Conversation Entailment</h3>
											<p>
												I did this project for the course EECS 595 Natural Language Processing. Textual entailment is a common task for training
												NLP models. The SLED Lab of University of Michigan had developed a unique <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/sled-umich/Conversation-Entailment">dataset</a>
												where the text was natural human conversation. I took inspiration from the <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkeJRhNYDH">TabFact paper</a>
												to compare the performance of the base BERT model and RoBERTa model on the dataset using two different representations of the data:
												the first "Para" approach where the conversations are written as directly quoted speech,
												and the second "KeyValue" approach where the conversations are written using
												speaker-dialogue pairs separated by a colon. I utilized the HuggingFace library for my experiments and found that
												for both models, the "KeyValue" representation gave the best accuracy, with the RoBERTa model achieving the best
												overall accuracy of 64.04%.

											<h3><a href="https://github.com/tondakshay/cotuning">Co-tuning for Transfer Learning</a></h3>
											<p>
												This was a project I did for the course EECS 545 Machine Learning. We wanted to test the effectiveness of a cutting edge
												transfer learning technique, <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/c8067ad1937f728f51288b3eb986afaa-Paper.pdf">co-tuning</a>,
												on a relatively unexplored dataset, which was the
												<a href="http://tacodataset.org/">TACO trash dataset</a>. Co-tuning aims to learn a relationship between the categories
												of two different datasets, and use it along with a pre-trained model on one dataset to supervise the training of a model
												on the second dataset. We used a Resnet50 backbone trained on ImageNet and transferred it onto the TACO dataset.
												This was my first experience getting my hands dirty with Pytorch, which was the framework we used.
												I learned about the training flow with Pytorch, as well as how to write a DataLoader for custom datasets.

											<h3>N-way Superscalar Out-of-Order R10K Processor</h3>
											<p>
												This was a project I did for the course EECS 470 Computer Architecture. We implemented an R10K style out-of-order machine using
												the Verilog Hardware description language. In order to boost the performance of the processor, we included a prefetcher unit,
												instruction and data caches, a load-store queue, a branch predictor and a branch target buffer. This project gave me a lot of useful
												insight into the low level design and architecture of computer processors, and sparked an interest in the possibility of designing
												hardware optimized machine learning systems.
